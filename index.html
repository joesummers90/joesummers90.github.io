        <h2>Joseph Summers</h2>
        <p>I am looking to change careers from <br>being a Tattoo Artist to a Software Developer.</p>
        <p>I have been teaching myself various languages through <br>online courses since January 11th 2024, which means <br> 
            I've been working towards this goal for <span id="hours">00:00:00</span> hours & counting...</p>
        <!--Big open section with name and image to fill initial viewport before allowing scroll? Make nav menu and icon to open/slide out and bring up links
        lorem ipsum - include image? Make image box more interesting (floating/moving/not boring square/maybe increases in size on hover)
        Include an interactive counter for how long I've been learning?-->
